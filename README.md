Simple Grapher for Quadratic Formulas using the c++ console 

- First 5 x and y values are graphed and printed
- Approximation used for graphing, goes to the closest number divisible by 5 or 50 depending on size of graph



- Issues:
- May have issues for numbers below 5 that aren't the first value, however this shouldnt happen given the quadratic formula equation, unless we use 0 for one of the constants
- Does not work for negative numbers
- Due to the simplicity/size of the graph, we can't properly show exact values and graph may appear off compared to real graph



- Thoughts:
- Did this as a practice exercise after learning some struct/class logic, still need to understand it further
- Most likely need to rewrite functions to be prettier/use less memory.
- Need a deeper understanding of pointers, used one to resolve an issue, but unsure of why it was needed
